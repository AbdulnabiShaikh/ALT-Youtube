# Alt Youtube

> **Abstract** : In the contemporary digital landscape, online video platforms have become integral to our 
lives, offering a wealth of content that captivates our attention for extended periods. However, 
the allure of such platforms often leads to excessive use, resulting in decreased productivity 
and detachment from real-world activities. This project aims to address the urgent need for a 
solution that promotes healthier digital engagement. 
Our mission is to develop a video streaming application that acts as a rehabilitation center for 
individuals affected by excessive online video consumption, particularly on platforms like 
YouTube. We recognize the significance of this work in the context of the current digital era, 
where individuals frequently struggle to strike a balance between online and offline activities. 
The proposed application leverages a strategic approach to influence user behavior positively. 
Rather than catering to user interests, it employs an innovative method of video 
recommendation. Instead of reinforcing users' preferences, the application identifies their 
favorite topics and purposefully recommends content from opposite domains, thus encouraging 
users to explore diverse and unexplored interests.
